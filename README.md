# classmate

**A WORK-IN-PROGRESS**

A configurable, flexible, functional CSS library.

## Developing

To start developing:

```
git clone https://github.com/reid47/classmate.git

cd classmate

yarn run watch
```

(That last one can also be `npm run watch`, if you prefer.)

This will start up a local server at `localhost:8080` that will watch
your files and live-reload the web pages upon changes. It will also
live-compile the SCSS files into CSS and the Pug files into HTML.
